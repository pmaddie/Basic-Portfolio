                        <p class="paragraph1">     I am a 25 year old Web Developer from Orlando, Fl. I have been on my Web Dev journey for almost
                        two years. I got my certification from UCF Coding Bootcamp in May 2019.

                        <p class="paragraph2">     blah blah blah blah Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. Fear is the path to 
                        the dark side ... fear leads to anger ... anger leads to hate…hate leads to suffering. Difficult 
                        to see. Always in motion is the future.. When you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For 
                        the dark side looks back. You must unlearn what you have unlearned.

                        <p class="paragraph3">     Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. Do. Or do not. There is no try. Much 
                        to learn you still have…my old padawan. ... This is just the beginning! You will know good 
                        from bad when you are at peace and passive. A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear 
                        into anger.
