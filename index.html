                   <!-- bio  -->
                        <p class="paragraph1">     I am a 25 year old Web Developer from Orlando, FL. I have been on my Web Developer journey for almost two years. 
                                I got my certification from UCF Coding Bootcamp in May 2019. It started as a hobby that I fell in love with as it 
                                allows me to be creative and technical simultaneously. I have a few other good hobbies I plan to grow into something 
                                that will allow me to generate income that way I can continue to strive for a lifestyle that gives me have more control 
                                and freedom! Other things I love would include fashion and sewing, exercising, personal development and socializing 
                                and travel, when possible.
                    </p>
                        <p class="paragraph2">     I was born and raised in Jacksonville, FL with my two sisters and little brother, me being the middle sister. 
                                I also have a niece who I am very close with and a handsome little nephew that I love just as much! I am extremely
                                 family oriented and one day I plan to have a family of my own. Until then, I will be building myself, adding to 
                                 my resume stamping my passport and enjoying and creating my best life.
                     </p>
                
                        <p class="paragraph3">     Some fun facts about me are; my favorite mammal is a French bulldog and my favorite bird is a hawk; 
                                I used to play basketball and I am a huge LeBron James fan #JamesGang!; I am an empath and can be very 
                                sensitive at times; I was student council president and to this day, that's the last time I cared about
                                 politics; I've been through a lot, like most people in this world and that is another reason why I aim 
                                 to be an extreme success. One of my favorite quotes is, "A ship is safe in harbor, but that is not what 
                                 ships are made for."
